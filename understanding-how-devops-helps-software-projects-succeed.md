# Understanding How DevOps Helps Software Projects Succeed

An introduction to the DevOps, its benefits, and how it makes software projects more successful.  This workshop will help convey the key cultural and process components of DevOps, and give you tools necessary to implement them in your organization.

# 1. Background

Agile DevOps (a portmanteau of Development and Operations) is a holistic approach to engineering, testing, operating, and maintaining software applications and their dependencies in an Agile manner.  DevOps leverages the robust communication patterns of Agile software development, and further adds a culture and process whereby all members of the software team work together in an environment of shared responsibility.

Agile embraces the idea that software requirements and priorities constantly change; and that conversations involving real-world examples produce the best requirements.  By emphasizing robust communication and short feedback loops, further bolstered by real-world prototypes, Agile reduces technical risk and the cost of incorrect assumptions.

This approach of maximizing communication, and driving a product's strategy via empirical evidence makes Agile an extremely effective way to manage a software project.

However, Agile is often only applied to the development part of the software lifecycle.  In this case, an Agile software development team will have strong feedback loops and use prototypes to spur robust conversation, while other members of the team remain isolated.  These groups include:

* **Testing:** Functional and user acceptance testing.
* **Build/Deployment:** Compiling an application for distribution or deployment.
* **Operations:** Maintaining an application in a production capacity.
* **Security:** Ensuring that an application and its data are protected from malicious usage.
* **Incident Response:** Responding to errors or outages.
* **Monitoring:** Knowing an application's state and how it is affecting customers.

With DevOps, all members of the team work together to produce working software that benefits the customer.  This way everyone fully understands the customers needs and how to holistically fulfill them.  Some examples include:

* **Software Architecture:** How the application is developed will mimic the production needs and constraints.
* **Capacity Planning:** Ensuring the production application serves the expected user volume.
* **Codified Operations:** The exact specification for every server is saved and audited for future use.
* **Automated Builds/Deploys:** New team members will know how to test/build/deploy the application quickly and easily.
* **Security Review:** New features, components and architecture are vetted early and continuously, to ensure compliance.
* **Robust Uptime:** Software and infrastructure can work together to "self-heal" if necessary.

In this way, DevOps eliminates barriers between team members and brings the benefits of the Agile process through to the entire software development lifecycle.

## 3. Objectives

The goal of this workshop is to help you understand the following:

1. What DevOps is exactly, how it builds upon Agile Development, and what benefits it brings to reducing technical risk.
1. How DevOps can fit in, and help close gaps within, your current stake holder needs and processes.
1. How coalescing roles within a team leads to a culture of shared responsibility, and how DevOps depends on strong collaboration.
1. How automation fits into DevOps, and understanding the different types and benefits of automation.
1. How the different facets of the DevOps Software Lifecycle (such as Configuration Management and Automated Deployments) work together holistically.
1. How to explain DevOps to others, and how to generate buy-in for its adoption within your organization.
1. How to identify when DevOps is being done correctly, and what flags to watch for when trouble happens.
